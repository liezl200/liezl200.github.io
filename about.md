About This Site
---------------
This website was built by customizing [Jekyll Bootstrap](http://jekyllbootstrap.com) ([Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) + [Bootstrap](http://twitter.github.io/bootstrap/ "Twitter Bootstrap")).  

To see how I finally overcame my frustration with Ruby Gems and started this site, see [my blog post]({{ BASE_PATH }}/tutorial/2013/04/14/Launching-Day "Launching Day!").
