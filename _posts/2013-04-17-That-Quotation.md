Very few quotations greatly affect me, but this is one of those few.

>"A human being in perfection ought always to preserve a calm and peaceful mind and never to allow passion or a transitory desire to disturb his tranquility. I do not think that the pursuit of knowledge is an exception to this rule." - Dr. Frankenstein

I won't burden you with my interpretation.
